# Countdown timer

With this app you can add countdown timers for Homey.
With countdown timers you can for example start a timer for a certain amount of seconds when a motion-detection sensor detected motion and turn lights on. When the sensor detects motion again it sets the timer again.
When the timer runs out you can turn off the lights.

No settings needed, just create a flow and start your timers. Easy and simple!
